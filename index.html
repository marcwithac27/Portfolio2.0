                                    Hello and My Name is Marc Maldonado and how I have always got people to remember me is to introduce myself as Marc with A C and the name of my company is With A C Operations Inc. I started off as as electrician building gas stations. In doing this it introduced me to the world of I.T. I started off wiring in networks but had no clue how to set one up. Eventually I would learn and make a business out of it. 

                                    <br>

                                    My first client was a  call center and that opened the door for me to 1 of the loves of my life Salesforce. I get my Administrator certificate and realize I wanted to learn more. My dream is to develop the most innovative and user friendly apps on Salesforce. Also I would like to ensure that I provide superior support and a vast knowledge base for my customers.
