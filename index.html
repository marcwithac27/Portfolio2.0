                    Hello and My Name is Marc Maldonado and how I have always got people to remember me is to introduce
                    myself as Marc with A C and the name of my company is With A C Operations Inc. I started off as as
                    electrician building gas stations. In doing this it introduced me to the world of I.T. I started off
                    wiring in networks but had no clue how to set one up. Eventually I would learn and make a business
                    out of it.

                <p>
                    My first client was a call center and that opened the door for me to 1 of the loves of my life
                    Salesforce. I get my Administrator certificate and realize I wanted to learn more. My dream is to
                    develop the most innovative and user friendly apps on Salesforce. Also I would like to ensure that I
                    provide superior support and a vast knowledge base for my customers.
